# Grab from SEDI 

Copying data from <a href="https://www.sedi.ca/sedi/">SEDI</a> (Canada&rsquo;s System for Electronic Disclosure of Insiders, an insider trading report database) pages and pasting into Excel can be a bit touch-and-go, so this bookmarklet downloads a CSV version of the "insider transaction detail" page. Go to the URL below, drag the button into your bookmarks bar and you&rsquo;re good to go. Will only work in latest versions of desktop Chrome and Firefox.
